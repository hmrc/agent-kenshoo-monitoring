Integrates graphite metrics via Kenshoo into Play applications, for in-bound and out-bound calls. 
White-listing of URLs is possible for both.

## Note

This library is currently intended for use by the Agent Services team. Since v4.3.0 and to support services using Play 2.6, the library no longer has a dependency on HttpVerbs. You will need an instance of HttpClient and an implicit ExecutionContext defined in scope.
